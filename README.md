# Attendance Management Web Admin (Face Recognition Attendance System) - Frontend

## Introduction
This project focuses on implementing a facial recognition-based attendance system with backend support. The project leverages ReactJS, Redux, and Tailwind CSS to construct an efficient admin page for class attendance management. The integration of these technologies ensures a robust and cohesive solution.

## Setup

1. Install required libraries using the following command:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

2. Run the API using the main script:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

## Additional Notes
- Make sure our backend code is running to make everything smoother and less rework. Here's the link to our BE repo: https://github.com/nhut3110/iot-face-recognize-system
